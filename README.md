# Fun

This repository gathers various little projects I have been working on, from small ETLs to haggle competitions or little python gadgets.


### 1. ETL

This folder contains small ETL programs.

For now, there is only one, built for requesting data to Zoho API (Zoho is an online CRM system) and inserting it in a Google Spreadsheet.

More information is available in the folder's README.md file.

### 2. Gadget

This folder contains various small python "gadgets" which I implemented for fun, when I was a Python newcomer.

More information is available in the folder's README.md file. 


### 3. Kaggle

This folder gathers my work on several small Kaggle competitions I participated to.

More information is available in the folder's README.md file.
